In oral glucose tolerance test, plasma glucose slowly increases from 5.5 to 9.5 mM over 60 min and returns to basal over the subsequent 3 h (Figure 2A). In healthy subjects, the rate of insulin secretion, facilitated by the secretion of gut-derived incretins (130), closely mirrors the glucose concentration.</p><p>The majority of in vitro studies employing isolated islets, dissociated primary cells or insulinoma cell lines, have employed a simplified protocol involving a step increase in extracellular glucose, typically from 2.8–3 to 11–16 mM or even higher. Islets show a biphasic release of insulin, with an initial rapid and transient release followed by a slowly accelerating secretion, particularly at supramaximal glucose .

Any drop in Δp, and hence ΔGp, is immediately sensed by the glycolytic pathway to increase the flux to restore Δp and ATP levels. In beta-cells, over the range 140-100 mV, the endogenous proton leak was roughly ohmic and exerted a high level of control over respiration and Δp</p><p>The activity of muscle contration is controlled by flux (ATP turnover) rather than ATP/ADP ratio, and the opposite in beta-cells.</p><p><span class=image-container><span class=link><img class=img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/97673822-62015280-1ac7-11eb-8de0-b94fbc8d7435.png alt=image></span><span class=caption><span class=title>Mitochondrial respiration in INS-1 cells</span></span></span></p><p>ΔpH increased from −0.13 units in 2.5 mM glucose to −0.51 units in 16.7 mM glucose, probably as a consequence of Ca2+ uptake into the matrix.
