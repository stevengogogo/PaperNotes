## OVERVIEW
* DOX's mechanisms of action underlying cancer cell killing and induction of cardiotoxicity and heart failure, a major limiting factor of the drug’s clinical use, remain to be further elucidated
* redox cycling in mitochondria, topoisomerase inhibition, and oxidative stress

## OXIDATIVE STRESS
* tightly regulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a fundamental mechanism of innate immunity and physiological homeostasis

### Doxorubicin-Mediated Oxidative Stress
* decreased expression of cellular antioxidant defenses
* activation of ROS-generating enzymes/proteins, including NOX2 and Rac1
* disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) by doxorubicin either directly (cardiolipin insertion) or indirectly (mtDNA damage)

### Nrf2 Signaling
* Short term exposure to doxorubicin may cause activation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2), leading to transient increases in antioxidant gene expression

## REDOX CYCLING

* there is no direct evidence for doxorubicin to undergo redox cycling to generate ROS at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (0.1-1.0 μM) in target cells and tissues

## TOPOISOMERASE INHIBITION

* Doxorubicin-induced anticancer activity from inhibition of TOP => dsDNA breaks
* **topoisomerase IIβ** (TOP2B) in haert mitochondria are also affected. topoisomerase IIb serves as a mediator, rather than an ultimate target, of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity

* inhibit doxorubicin’s binding to topoisomerase IIb would be effective (e.g. dexrazoxane)

## MOLECULAR TARGET-DRIVEN STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING DOXORUBICIN’S THERAPEUTIC INDEX
* so far **no antioxidants** have been shown to protect against doxorubicin’s cardiotoxicity or augment its anticancer activity in human cancer patients. (Not mito-targeted?)
* dexrazoxane: iron chelator, inhibits DOX binding to topIIβ
* novel agents that enhance doxorubicin-induced tumoricidal activity?
