## Introduction
![](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/c2b005cf-14f9-47b6-be57-3899491622e3/gr1_lrg.jpg)
* Ion regulation (H+, Na+, Ca2+, Pi) are incorporated into the guinea pig heart mitochondria model.
    * equilibrium constants and multiple acid-base equilibria of metabolites with H+
    * associations with Mg2+
    * dependence of IDH and MDH on pH
    * SDH as part of the ETC
    * parameters were either obtained directly from the literature or optimized by minimizing the differences between the model simulation and experimental data
    * Ionic fluxes was tested under steady-state and time-dependent situations
    * state 4 to state 3 transition: a highly energized (i.e., high ΔΨm) and reduced redox status of low respiration and ATP synthesis to high respiratory and ATP synthesis fluxes.
* Tested the model at the steady state by studying the dependence of respiratory and ATP synthesis fluxes on their driving forces (i.e., Δp, redox, and phosphorylation potentials)

## Results

### Steady-state behavior

* As ADPi increases, it is taken up into the matrix, raising the ADPm steady-state level. Higher ADPm decreases the phosphorylation potential, leading to an increase in ATP synthesis, dissipattion of the proton motive force, Δp, NADH consumption and a drop of its redox potential.
* E/F: substrate deprivation

### Calcium uniporter, NHE, and PiC fluxes in relation to pmf

* the flux through PiC decreases with Δp subsequent to the Pi demand for phosphorylation by the ATP synthase
* The range of flux values is rather narrow, but it agrees well with the range of Ca2+ uptake fluxes determined experimentally in isolated heart mitochondria

### Time-dependent behavior

* The apparent incomplete collapse of ΔΨm seen in the experimental data may be due to the dynamic range of the ΔΨm probe, TMRM, which is sensitive within the range of 130–210 mV under our experimental conditions

### Transition from state 4 to state 3

* simulated RCR of ∼2.5, similar to experiments.
* reversal of the H+ pumping direction upon uncoupling, as expected
* P/O ratio: 1.67 to 2.02 in Fig2. 0.5 in state 4 to 1.25 in state 3. negative upon uncoupling.

### Mitochondrial pH and Pi responses during energetic transitions
![](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/1a7ebb60-5570-4705-b650-9bc155d8522b/gr6_lrg.jpg)
* EXP: Addition of 2.0 mM Pi => increase of ΔΨm and a higher reduction of NADH
* MODEL: change in ΔΨm, but the level of NADH remained constant
* PiC: Pi/OH antiport, Pi uptake triggers intramitochondrial acidification, resulting in a decrease of the ΔpH component of Δp.
* large buffering capacity of H+ => pH_mito barly changes

## Discussion
* This model involves interactions between **energetics** (i.e., TCA cycle, respiration, and ATP synthesis fluxes) and the dynamics of several **ions**, including Ca2+, Na+, Pi, and H+
* The Δp is used for the import of respiratory substrates and Pi (driven by ΔpH), ADP in exchange for ATP through the ANT (driven by ΔΨm), volume regulation (K+, Na+, and anions), energetic signaling (Ca2+), and heat production (H+)
* Na+ levels increased (∼10%) during energization of the membrane after substrate addition, and decreased (∼13%) in state 3 after ADP addition. Na+ is also known to increase in cardiac mitochondria after episodes of ischemia/reperfusion. Mitochondrial NHE activity also appears to be required for steady-state Ca2+ cycling in energized mitochondria.
* The model does not account for direct activation of TCA cycle dehydrogenases by Pi, partly explain the lack of increase in NADH observed in the simulations after a pulse of Pi
* The addition of cyanide shows a close agreement for changes in ΔΨm, i.e., 10 mV (from ∼180 mV to ∼170 mV) as compared with 5 mV (from 165 mV to 160 mV) observed in the experiments

### Validation tests
* respiratory (VO2) and ATP synthesis (VATPsynthase) fluxes to the driving forces (Δp, AF1, Ares)
* simulation of experimental profiles of ΔΨm and NADH during the transition between states 2/4 and 3, hypoxia (mimicked by CN− addition), and uncoupling by DNP
* simulation of the increase in VO2 and VATPsynthase upon addition of ADP, decrease under hypoxia and reversal of the ATP synthase during uncoupling
* reproduction of changes in ΔΨm after Pi addition during state 2/4 respiration
* interconversion between ΔpH and ΔΨm after addition of Pi

## Strengths and limitations of the mitochondrial model
* optimized the model parameters by adjusting the kinetic constants to reproduce experimental measurements of state variables:
    * TCA cycle intermediates
    * H+ concentration (pH_mito > pH_cyto)
    * Na+ concentration in the matrix (close to the extramitochondrial)
    * steady-state levels of ΔΨm and NADH in state 4
    * fluxes of uniporter (Vuni) and respiratory rates (VO2)

* Differences: fast relaxation of the state variables observed in the experiments. Some processes are omitted, such as transport of K+ and its associated effect on mitochondrial matrix volume, and the metabolism of ROS. These processes consume Δp and redox potential (e.g., through transhydrogenase activity), resulting in an increase in respiration and a faster NADH consumption rate.

## Comparison with previous models of mitochondrial energetics
* Beard also presented a detailed model that encompassed ion transport, including Pi, K+, and H+. But oxidative phosphorylation rate expressions assume **linear** flow-force, not S-shaped. And it does not account for Na+ or Ca2+ transport or its effects on energy metabolism.

* The model exhibits an exponential relationship between mitochondrial and extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations, and also accounts for H+ dynamics, the acid-base equilibria of metabolites, and the pH dependence of thermodynamic constants.
