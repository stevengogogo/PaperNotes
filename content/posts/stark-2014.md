## Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
* Reaction: GTP + oxaloacetate (OAA) → GDP + phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) + CO₂, requires magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn)
* Cytosolic PEPCK (PEPCK-C): regulated by hormones (stimulated by glucagon and suppressed by insulin), for gluconeogenesis
* Mitochondrial PEPCK (PEPCK-M): regulated by citric acid cycle (CAC) flux

## More about PEPCK-M
* Limited by mitochondrial GTP from citric acid cycle (CAC) flux of GTP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-GTP)
  * mitochondrial GTP has no way out, unlike mitochondrial ATP
  * PEPCK-M: Sensor of CAC flux as well as the amount of intermediates from mtGTP
  * SCS-GTP/SCS-ATP performing nucleotide diphosphokinase (NDPK) reaction in the mitochodnrial matrix
  * The real NDPK lies in the intermembrane space, feeding mitochondrial GTPases for fission/fusion (Drp1, OPA1)
* Removal of CAC intermediates (cataplerosis) to balance replenishment of CAC intermediates (anaplerosis)
* Glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in islet beta cells[^Jesinkey2019]
* Provider of a relatively constant supply of PEP
* PEP regulates both mitochondrial calcium transport and ATP/ADP exchange

## Generation of PEP

PEPCK-M is a more direct and more energy-efficient way to generate PEP from OAA.

* Triggers and amplifies normal GSIS
* Cell proliferation
* Augmented mitochondrial mass
* Increased insulin granule number, and membrane proximity
* PEPCK-M biochemically transduces the mtGTP signal out to the cytosol by synthesizing PEP
