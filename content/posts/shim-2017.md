## Introduction
* Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), anticancer durgs, have cardiotoxicity: heart failure, cardiomyopathy, conduction abnormalities, QT prolongation, and myocardial injury
* cardio-oncology: antineoplastic medication causing cardiotoxicity
* on-target toxicity (TKs crucial to cardiomyocytes) & off-target toxicity (other kinases)
* To research:
    * TKIs affect **signaling networks** in cardiomyocytes
    * Find interventions that can reverse and/or mitigate any associated cardiotoxicity
* quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) approach
* chemical classes of TKIs
    1. humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
    2. Small molecule TKIs

## Mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity caused by TKIs

### Survival signaling
* ERBB2, target of trastuzumab, plays an important role in maintaining cardiomyocyte health
* ERBB1, target of erlotinib, has also been implicated in cardioprotection and myocyte survival
* The PI3K-Akt axis, downstream of ERBB, is critical in survival signaling
* Raf-1 (serine/threonine kinases): cardiotoxicity caused by sorafenib inhibition of Raf-1 and then disinhibition of pro-apoptotic kinases

### Sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial homeostasis
* mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from TKI treatment can lead to **membrane permeabilization** and the release of **reactive oxidative species (ROS)** to the cytoplasm
* then SR dysfunction through both altered Ca2+ release
* e.g. imatinib =>  dilated SR structures, ΔΨ collapse
* sunitinib => off-target inhibition of AMPK, ATP depletion

### Excitation and contraction
* direct or indirect modulation of cardiac ionic currents, resulting in pro-arrhythmic electrical activity
    * Direct decrease in **hERG** K+ (repolarizing) currents => QTc prolong
    * Inhibition of Src also induce the above

* structural remodeling that leads to altered myocyte contraction
    * Src inhibition
    * Src is critival in organization of sarcomeres and the formation of focal adhesions that connect adjacent cell

## Complexities of TKI-induced cardiotoxicity and the need for a systems approach
* it would be beneficial to develop a systematic strategy to
    1. evaluate the potential cardiotoxicity of new TKIs;
    2. predict the mostly likely mechanisms involved
    3. suggest strategies for mitigating and/or reversing toxicity.
* cell based, high-throughput drug screening assay
    * Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)
    * limited insight into the dynamics of toxicity development (one cannot measure all the things!). The mechanistic details often remain hidden even the results are clear.

## Mechanistic mathematical modeling (QSP models) to improve toxicity testing
* QSP models have been exploited to understand cardiotoxicity caused by anthracyclines (de Oliveira et al, 2016)
* An example of the success of QSP models: DILIsym for hepatotoxicity

## Initial efforts to use QSP approaches to understand TKI-induced cardiotoxicity

* tyrosine kinase signaling encompasses large, complex networks with numerous feedback loops,
* “toxicity index” [^Sharma2017]: effects of TKIs in hiPSC-CMs through several assays. QSP is complementary to this data-driven model.
* β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol => apoptosis[^Shin2014]. simulations often generate novel experimentally-testable predictions
* DtoxS—Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center—SOP, https://martip03.u.hpc.mssm.edu/sop.php
    * Drug => gene expression changes
    * Data are released at the DToxS website and can be freely-downloaded: https://martip03.u.hpc.mssm.edu/data.php
* mRNA levels => model parameters
* CMC signaling model[^Ryall2012]
    * many known TKI targets (e.g., ERBB2, Raf-1) and critical nodes in cardiac survival signaling (e.g., PI3K, Akt, and ERK) are included
* BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) as heart failure biomarker. Nilotinib increased BNP level of CMCs when in stimuli
* In myocytes that are not exposed to a physiological stimulus, TKIs and non-TKIs cause similar changes in hypertrophy biomarkers. Under stimulations from isoproterenol or endothelin-1, the pro-hypertrophic response is exaggerated in TKI-treated cells, compared with non-TKI-treated ones.

### Benefits of simulations
1. Making predictions from existing data
2. Quantitative (dose-response) results to prioritize experimental tests and use resources efficiently
3. predict the mechanisms responsible for the differences between indivisuals and/or drug classes

## Future directions
* describing direct inhibition of kinase activity by drugs (RNA expr only for now)
* additional biological processes potentially involved in cardiotoxicity
    * e.g. models describing **mitochondrial function**, including the production of reactive oxygen species

## Conclusions
The initial results presented here show how mechanistic models can be integrated with “omics” measurements such as mRNA-seq, generating simulations that can suggest underlying mechanisms and help in prioritizing costly experiments.
