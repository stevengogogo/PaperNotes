## Introduction
* Haldane relationship, an equation which can only be used for reversible reactions, connects biochemical thermodynamics and biochemical kinetics (Keq =(Vf KmP) / (Vr KmA))

## Kinetic Equations of Reversible Reactions
### Uni-Uni Mechanisms
* Simplest: Michaelis-Menten mechanism.

* Adair irreversible equation is presented only for an enzyme with two active centers.

### Bi-Bi Mechanisms
* both irreversible equations can be simplified to a Michaelis-Menten uni-uni equation by considering saturated the concentration of one of the substrates
* Haldane relationship from these equations can be solved by considering that equilibrium concentrations would led to v = 0

### Multisubstrate Mechanisms
