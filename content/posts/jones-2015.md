## Introduction to Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
  * increased Ca2+ load
  * impairment of cytosolic ATPases
  * an increase in active Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
  * mitochondria are placed under strain leading to energetic impairment and an  increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
  * Decreased PCr / ATP
  * Decrease in levels of NADPH (antioxidant capacity)

## Methods
* EP: Oâ€™Hara-Rudy (ORd) ventricular cell model
* Contraction: metabolite sensitive formulation by Tran et al.:
* mitochondrial energetics with ROS: Gauthier et al.
* ATP and Cr shuttle: ECME model by Cortassa

* 14% reduction of the PCr/ATP ratio
* 26% decrease in mitochondrial NADPH

## Discussions
The effects increased Ca2+ sensitivity and electrical remodeling have on the contractile properties of the cell, energetics, and levels of ROS production
