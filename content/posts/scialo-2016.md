## Mitochondrial ROS Produced via Reverse Electron Transport Extend Animal Lifespan

Graphical abstract[^Scialo2016]

## Introduction

* ROS as harmful => ROS as secondary messenger
* use of alternative respiratory enzymes, absent from mammals and flies, to modulate ROS generation at specific sites of the ETC
    * Alternative oxidase (AOX) of *Ciona intestinalis* bypassing CIII and CIV
    * NDI1 : rotenone-insensitive alternative NADH dehydrogenase, bypassing CI
    *
## Results and discussion
### Aging: ROS increased, CI resp. decreased

* A: Representative images of dissected fly brains stained with MitoSOX from wild-type flies of the indicated ages.
* B: Quantification of (A) (n = 5).
* C: Representative EM images of Dahomey flight muscle sections at 1,000x magnification dissected at the indicated ages (n = 10, 1 muscle per fly; red arrows indicated exemplar swollen, rounded mitochondria, see Figure S1C for quantification).
* D: Mitochondrial respiration in Dahomey and Oregon R flies at the indicated ages (n = 6).
* E: CI and CIII enzymatic activity in wild-type flies of the indicated ages (n = 5).
* F: CI (NDUFS3), CII (SDHB), CIII (CYTOB), CIV (COX4), and CV (ATP5A) levels in wild-type flies. GAPDH is used as a loading control.
* G: Quantification of (F).
* H: ImpL3 expression in wild-type flies of the indicated ages.


### Over-Reduction of the CoQ Pool Increases ROS Production and Extends Lifespan
* Extension of lifespan accompanied by increase in ROS (!!)
    * NDI1 + CI (NDI1 reduces Q, increased CI-ROS)
* No extension of lifespan
    * AOX + CI (AOX oxidizes Q)
    * AOX + NDI1 + CI (AOX oxidizes Q)
    * NDI1 only (CI knock down, less reduced Q and less CI-ROS)
    * Added mitochondrial Catalase (Decreased ROS
* Where does the ROS comes from?
    * Rotenone (specific CI Q-site inhibitor) significantly decreases ROS formation in ND1 expressing flies but increases ROS formation in wildtype flies. **RET is the source of NDI1-mediated ROS production**
    * FCCP (Uncoupler) depleted NDI1-mediated ROS production
    * myxothiazol (a CIII Qo site inhibitor): no effect
    * During **ischemia reperfusion** RET is the main source of superoxide in vivo [^Chouchani2014]

* A: Representative images of dissected brains from indicated genotypes stained with MitoSOX.
* B: Quantification of (A) (n = 5).
* C: Survival curves for the indicated genotypes (n = 200).
* D: Schematic diagram illustrating effects of expressing two different alternative respiratory enzymes on electron transport: (i) NDI1 generates ROS by over-reducing the CoQ pool; (ii) AOX reverts the effects of NDI1 by re-oxidizing the CoQ pool; (iii) decrease in the levels of CI can prevent reduction of CoQ and subsequent ROS production; (iv) ectopic expression of mtCAT reduces ROS levels without altering mitochondrial respiration or the redox state of CoQ.
* E: Representative images of brains from the indicated genotypes stained with MitoSOX.
* F: Quantification of (E) (n = 5).
* G: Survival curves for the indicated genotypes (n = 160).
* H: In vivo ROS measurements from indicated genotypes in brains dissected from flies expressing a mitochondrially localized redox-sensitive GFP-based reporter.
* I: Quantification of (H) (n = 5–7).
* J: Quantification of brains dissected from flies of the indicated genotypes stained with MitoSOX (n = 5).
* K: Survival curves for the indicated genotypes (n = 200).
* L: Diagram illustrating using metabolic poisons to dissect ROS production: rotenone (ROT), carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), or myxothiazol (MYX). Green dashed arrows indicate the possible flow of electrons following CoQ reduction.
* M: Quantification of brains dissected from NDI1 flies fed with metabolic poisons, stained with MitoSOX (n = 4).


### CoQ-Mediated ROS Signaling Can Rescue Pathology Induced by Oxidative Stress

* SOD2 (mitochondrial SOD) knockdown : increase in superoxide and decrease in hydrogen peroxide, dramatically shortened lifespan
* High level of superoxide inhibits CI and aconitase activity
* AOX decreased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, but little improvement
* NDI1 expression partially rescued lifespan along with CI respiration and activity ( increasing ROS levels by RET)
    * disappeared when RET was prevented by depletion of CI levels by *GeneSwitch system*
* RET may be necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and lifespan extension

### Loss of CoQ-Mediated ROS Signaling Accelerates Aging

## Summary
* mtROS production increases with age
* un-detoxified ROS can be detrimental to Drosophila lifespan
* But increasing ROS production specifically from reduced CoQ, possibly via RET acts as a signal to maintain mitochondrial function (notably CI) and extend lifespan
* Manipulation of the redox state of CoQ may be a strategy for the extension of both mean and maximum lifespan
