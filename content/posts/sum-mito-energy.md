## Energy metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix

### Pyruvate degydrogenation

Pyr (from glucolysis) + NAD + CoA -> (PDH) -> AcCoA + CO₂ + NADH

### TCA cycle
* Turns 1 AcCoA into 2 CO₂ molecules and reduces 3 NAD and 1 FAD per full cycle
* 1 ATP or 1 GTP generated per full cycle, depending on the subunit of SCS
* Anaplerosis: replenish TCA cycle intermediates by Pyr / amino acids
* Cataplerosis: draws TCA cycle intermediates for amino acids / lipogenesis / gluconeogenesis

#### Branches and shunts
  * Glu + NAD(P) <- (GDH) -> AKG + ammonia + NAD(P)H
  * Pyr + HCO₃⁻ + ATP -> (pyruvate carboxylase, PC) -> OAA + ADP + Pi
  * OAA + GTP -> (PEPCK-M) -> PEP + GDP + CO₂
  * Asp + AKG <-(AST)-> OAA + Glu
  * Asp -> (Urea cycle) -> fumarate
  * Lipogenesis: citrate out -> (citrate lyase) -> AcCoA (cytosolic)
  * GABA shunt: AKG -> Glu -> (Glutamate decarboxylase) -> GABA -> (transaminase)-> succinate semialdehyde -> (dehydrogenase) -> succinate

### Electron transport chain (ETC)

#### Complex I
NADH reduces ubiquinone: NADH + Q <-> NAD + QH₂
* Redox centers: FMN, FeS
* Pumps 4 protons per NADH oxidized
* Inhibited by rotenone (blocking qunione site)
* Forward electron transport (FET) vs reverse electron transport (RET, more ROS )
#### Complex II
Succinate reduces ubiquinone. succinate + Q <-> fumarate + QH₂
* Redox centers: FAD, FeS
* No proton pumping (Keq ≈ 1, almost no free energy drop)
* Inhibited by malonate and oxaloacetate (competitive inhibition)
* Associated with oxidative stress in ischemia-reperfusion injury (succinate overload)
#### Complex III
Ubiquinol reduces cytochrome c. 2QH₂ + 2c³⁺ <-> QH₂ + Q + 2c²⁺
* Redox centers: cytochrome b (low potential and high potential), FeS
* Protons are pumped indirectly with the Q cycle. (1 e⁻ per 1 cytochrome c reduced)
* Q oxidation on the p (outer) side (Qo site) and reduction om the n (inner) side (Qi site)
* Transient semiquinone radical @ Qo (responsible for superoxide generation) and more stable semiquinone radical @ Qi
  * Competing hypothesis for the machanism: semiforward vs semireverse
* Inhibited by Antimycin A (blocking Qi)
#### Complex IV
Cytochrome c reduces O₂. 4c²⁺ + O₂ + 4H⁺ -> 4c³⁺ + 2H₂O, irreversible reaction.
* Redox centers: cytochrome a's, Fe-Cu centers
* One proton pumped per electron transferred
* Inhibited physiologically by NO. Also inhibited by H₂S, CO, and cyanide.
* Photomodulation by near infrared (NIR) photons
* No (physiological) ROS generation

### ATP synthesis
By Complex V (ATP synthase)

* Consumes proton motive force (pmf) and potassium motive force (kmf) (*new*)
* Catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP and phosphate. Mg + ADP + Pi -> MgATP
* ~100 round per second at physiological conditions
* Inhibited by oligomycin
* Reversible during low ΔΨ (determined by Keq)
* But the rate favors ATP synthesis (limited ATP hydrolysis for intact ATP synthase)

## Ion flow
### Calcium
* In: mainly via mitochodrial clacium uniporter (MCU)
* Out: via natrium-calcium-lithium exchanger (NCLX)
* Bufferd by mitochondrial phosphate
* Enhances NAD reduction (CAC enzymes) and ATP synthesis
* Calcium buffer in the cell, coordinates with endoplasmic reticulum (the calcium reservior)
* Overload: mPTP open and cell death
### Natrium (sodium)
* In: via NCLX
* Out: via natrium-H exchanger (NHE)
* *Counter balance* of mitochondrial calcium
* In heart failure, increase in intrecellular sodium hinders mitochondrial calcium extrusion
### Kalium (potassium)
* In: mainly via mitochondrial ATP-inhibited potassium channel (mKATP) or ATP synthase
* Out: by kalium-H exchanger (KHE)
* Mitochondrial volume balance
* Ischemic preconditioning

## ROS scavenging and signaling
### Superoxide
* Byproduct of complex I, III
* Consumed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), oxidized cytochrome c
* May cross the IMM via inner mitochodnrial anion channel (IMAC), depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ)
* Group depolarization of mitochondria network
### Hydrogen peroxide
* Produced by SOD and complex I
* Consumed by glutathione and thioredoxin systems (mito and cytosol), plus catalase in the cytosol
* Assumed simple diffusion across the IMM
### NADPH
* The reducing equivalent
* Produced by transhydrogenase (THD): NADP + NADH <-> NADPH + NAD
* Levels affected by ΔΨ and NADH/NAD ratio
### Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
* Dismutate superoxide into O₂ and H₂O₂
* Cytosolic (SOD1[Cu-Zn]), mitochondrial (SOD2[Mn]), and extracellular (SOD3 [Cu-Zn])
* Inhibited by excessive H₂O₂?
### Catalase
* Dismutate H₂O₂ into H₂O and O₂
* Inhibited by excessive H₂O₂
### Glutathione (GSH) system
* Electron flow: NADPH -> (GSH reductase) -> GSH -> (GSH peroxidase) -> H₂O₂
* Repairs oxidized protein via glutaredoxin cycle
### Thioredoxin (Trx) system
* Electron flow: NADPH -> (Trx reductase) -> Trx -> (Trx peroxidase) -> H₂O₂
* Parallel to the GSH system
* Inhibited by excessive oxidation (to sulfate)
* Repairs oxidized protein via itself
