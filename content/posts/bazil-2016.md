Based on the two previous papers.[^Bazil2014][^Bazil2013]

## Introduction
* the concentration of cytoplasmic Pi is thought to be the most important feedback signal controlling oxidative phosphorylation
*  alternative hypothesis: open-loop stimulation by calcium => attempts to demonstrate these stimulatory effects within the physiological range of calcium concentrations, temperature, ionic strength, and substrate concentrations, have failed
* Elevated ROS levels from complex I caused by matrix alkalization after mitochondrial KATP channel opening contributes to cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. But the existence of the KATP channel is still debated
* Extrapolating ROS production rates measured in vitro to expected rates in vivo must be done with caution
* As it is currently extremely difficult to accurately measure ROS production in vivo, a mathematical model is required
* Our recent work identifying and analyzing thermodynamically constrained models describing the catalytic mechanisms of respiratory complexes Iand III
* predicts that an increase in the quinone pool (Q pool) redox state is responsible for the apparent activation of complex III by inorganic phosphate

## Materials and Methods

* The model descriptors for NADH production, complexes I, III, and IV were updated from the 2005 Beard model to capture the substrate/product and hydrogen peroxide/superoxide production kinetics

## Results and Discussion

* orange: with succinate accumulation. blue: without succinate accumulation
* For the ischemic period, the O2 concentration was set to 1 nM to reflect the hypoxic conditions during ischemia. For the reperfusion period, the O2 concentration was set back to the baseline value.
* For the I/R Simulation 2 conditions, RET is the dominant source of ROS and leads to a 10-fold higher ROS production rate compared to forward electron transport
* This conclusion is strongly corroborated by Chouchani et al. , who demonstrate that elevated ROS production during reperfusion after ischemia is due to accumulation of mitochondrial succinate

## Conclusion
* an oxidative-phosphorylation model that is capable of simulating ROS dynamics
* updated complexes I, III, and IV, and ANT
