## The chemiosmotic theory

* Electrochemical proton gradient (protonmotive force, Δp) driving mitochondrial ATP production

## Proton leak
* Protons can return to the matrix independently of ATP synthase.
* basal leak vs inducible leak
* Non-ohmic manner observed (exponential relation), even in intact cells

* Another explanation is the electron slip: e- transferred without pumping protons (esp. C4). This has not been convincingly demonstrated experimentally to occur under physiological conditions.

## Molecular nature of the basal proton leak
* The magnitude of proton conductance also correlates with the abundance of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (e.g. ANT, up to 2/3). H+ leaking via the interface btween the proteins and the lipid bilayer.
    * Not due to the protein activity (i.e. inhibitor-insensitive)

## Physiological significance of basal proton leak
* 20–30% of the resting metabolic rate of hepatocytes and up to **~50%** of the respiration of skeletal muscle of a rat, contributes significantly to basal metabolic rate (**BMR**), as the heat generator for mammals.
* protection by mild uncoupling against excessive ROS production

## Methodological considerations assaying leak in vivo
* futile proton cycling contributes to **~50%** of the respiratory rate
* calculating coupling efficiency by inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin

## The molecular nature of the inducible proton leak
* ANT: activated by activated by fatty acids and reactive alkenals, such as hydroxynonenal (**HNE**)
* UCP: activated by thyroxin, fatty acids

### Uncoupling protein 1
* In the brown adipose tissue
* Genarates heat, dissipates Δp. For thermal regulations in small mammals.
* Inhibited by purine nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates and activated by free fatty acids
* Mechanisms
    1. Cofactor
    2. FA cycling by UCP1
    3. simple competitive kinetics for activation of UCP1
* regulated by cellular signal transduction
    1. noradrenergic (sympathetic)
    2. thyroxines

### The function of novel uncoupling proteins
* paralogues of UCP1 => UCP2, UCP3
* Superoxide, and derived lipid peroxidation products such as HNE, activate UCP-mediated proton conductance

### ANT
* Exchange ATP for ADP across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), electrogenic (loses 1 charge in forward mode)
* FAs. superoxide and oxidative compounds (HNE) can also induce uncoupling via the ANT

## Electron leak
* From semiquinone radical (QH•) or reduced flavin
* Both superoxide anion (O2•−) and membrane-soluble hydroperoxyl radical (HO2•) exist
* Mainly from C1 & C3 (but there are reports that C2, KGDH, and others also produce some ROS)

### Complex I
* FMN (IF site) vs Q reductase (IQ site)
* During FET (G/M oxidation): FMN (IF site), ROS production enhanced by rotenone. Δp-dependent.
* During RET (succinate oxidation): Sensitive to Δp and IQ site inhibitors

### Complex III
* Bifurcation of electron flow (Q-cycle)
* Electrons taken fron QH2 are distributed rapidly in the cytochrome b, avoiding significant accumulation of QH• in the Qo site and thus superoxide generation
* Qo site inhibitors (stigmatellin and myxothiazol) blocks ROS generation from C3

### Topology of ROS formation
* Phospholipid bilayer membranes are highly impermeable to the anionic O2•−, and HO2• concentration is very small at physiological pH.
* ROS formation from complex I is directed solely to the matrix
* Superoxide production by complex III in the presence of antimycin A results in release of ROS to both the matrix and intermembrane
* α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase results in ROS production to both sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane

## Importance of proton and electron leak in disease

### Regulation of body weight by proton leak
* chemical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) for weight control: narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic doses, and nonspecific to tissues, withdrawn due to deaths.
* brown adipose tissue as a target for obesity treatment: upregulating UCP

### Modulating the insulin response through mild uncoupling
* **UCP2** was implicated as a negative regulator of insulin secretion, presumably by lowering the ATP/ADP ratio
* Knocking out UCP2 results in chronic oxidative stress
