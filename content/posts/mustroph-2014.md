## INTRODUCTION

* Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been identified as an important regulator of ion channels and transporters involved in cardiac excitation–contraction coupling under physiological but also pathophysiological conditions

## K CHANNELS ARE IMPORTANT REGULATORS OF CARDIAC EXCITABILITY
* Na current : upstroke (phase 0)
* Ito activation results in an early repolarization (notch, phase 1)
* ICa stabilizes the membrane potential during the plateau phase (phase 2). NCX is active.
* delayed rectifying K channels (IKr, IKs, and IKur): Repolarization (phase 3)
* resting membrane potential (phase 4) is stabilized by IK1 and NKA, NCX
* In pacemaker cells, the absence of a stabilizing IK1 is responsible for a more positive resting membrane potential. non-specific cation current If (channel protein HCN) can thus generate diastolic depolarization leading to the generation of APs.
* Reduced function of Kv7.1 and hERG are the hallmark of congential *long QT* syndrome 1 and 2, respectively . increased triggered activity due to early afterdepolarizations (EADs). ncreased triggered activity is an important consequence of prolonged repolarization.
* Mutation of ATP-sensitive K channel => prominent J wave on the ECG
* Differential K channel expression across the ventricular wall is the basis for transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) => positive T wave. Smaler Ito in endocardial cells => longer AP, higher plateau
* If 100% Ito expression was used ( = epicardial myocytes), CaMKII overexpression resulted in a shortening of the AP duration mainly due to a CaMKII-dependent enhancement of Ito. With 10% Ito expression ( = endocardial myocytes), however, AP duration increased because CaMKII-enhanced late INa and L-type Ca current outweighed the effect on the smaller Ito.

## CaMKII AND HF
* In human HF, expression and activity of CaMKII is increased.
* (Rats) increased AP duration, disturbed Ca handling, and are prone to ventricular arrhythmias

## TRANSIENT OUTWARD K CURRENT (Ito, both fast)

* With 2 time constants (45.6ms and 453.1ms). They are functionally and structurally independent ion currents.
* Reduced Ito density is known to contribute to AP prolongation and prolonged QT intervals
* overexpression of CaMKIIδ in rabbit myocytes *increases Ito*
* recovery from inactivation of Ito,fast and Ito,slow was enhanced by CaMKII overexpression
* CaMKII-dependent enhancement of Ito may also be important for reactive oxygen-species (ROS) induced arrhythmogenesis.
* Kv4.3 (ion channel of Ito) may function as a reservoir for inactive CaMKII-units and exert an influence on CaMKII activation levels
* Kv4.3 is downregulated in HF while CaMKII is upregulated

## INWARDLY RECTIFYING CURRENT (IK1)
* Kir2.1 (KCNJ2), Kir2.2 (KCNJ12), Kir2.3 (KCNJ4), and Kir2.4 (KCNJ14)
* important stabilizers of the resting membrane potential
* Inhibited or activated by calcium (species-dependent): direct ? via CaMKII? via PKC?
* CaMKII-dependent activation of IK1 also comes from rabbit ventricular myocytes.
* Both anti-arrhythmic and pro-arrhythmic
    * (Dog) reduced IK1 has been shown to increase the propensity for sudden cardiac death and ventricular tachycardia
    * (Rat) wild-type Kir2.1 overexpressing mice that have an increased propensity for ventricular arrhythmias

## DELAYED RECTIFYING K CHANNELS (IKr, IKs, IKur)
* Kv1.5 (KCNA5), hERG (KCNH2), and Kv7.1(KCNQ1) => IKur (ultra rapid), IKr (rapid), and IKs (slow), respectively
* IKur is only present in atrial myocardium. CaMKII increases IKur => pro-AF

## ATP-SENSITIVE POTASSIUM CURRENT KATP
* Kir6.1 (KCNJ8) and Kir6.2 (KCNJ11)
* ischemic preconditioning
* Inhibited by active CAMKII
* The significance of KATP in HF and arrhythmogenesis is still largely unknown
