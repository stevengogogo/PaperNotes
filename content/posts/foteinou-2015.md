## Introduction
* ROS overactivates CaMKII => altered excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and proarrhythmic electrical remodeling
* Activated CaMKII molecules can be autophosphorylated, retaining activity even upon dissociation of Ca2+/CaM
* oxidation activation at specific methionine residues of CaMKII, increasing early and delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs)
* CaMKII phosphorylates several proteins involved in ECC, including L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs), ryanodine receptors (RyRs), phospholamban (PLB)
* also phosphorylates sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels to regulate their function

## Materials and Methods
### Stochastic model of cardiac CaMKII activation
![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547162/bin/gr1.jpg)
* specifically for CaMKIIδ (cardiac)
* estricting CaMKII autophoshorylation events to occur only between adjacent CaMKII subunits

### Whole-cell model
* stochastic local-control ventricular myocyte model
* incorporates the functional effects of CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of LCCs, RyRs, PLB, and Na+ channels

## Results
### Rate dependence of H2O2-induced EADs

### CaMKII-INaL positive feedback loop in the presence of H2O2
* CaMKII enhances INaL. increase in INaL is sufficient to activate CaMKII (and enhance target phosphorylation) via elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated by reverse-mode NCX activity

## Discussion
* oxidative activation of both ICaL and INaL lengthens the APD and forms a conditioning phase that facilitates the synergy between INCX and ICaL reactivation
* ICaL significantly decreased due to shifts of LCC gating toward more inactivation via CDI and/or VDI.
### Limitations
* H2O2 model predicts an increase in SR Ca2+ leak (6-fold), ∼15-fold less than that measured experimentally
* CaMKII-independent mechanisms of ROS-mediated alteration of cardiac ECC
* unable to replicate H2O2-induced Na+ and Ca2+ overload and the subsequent occurrence of DADs
* does not incorporate CaMKII-dependent alterations of the transient outward K+ current (Ito), which tends to increase Ito and shorten APD in rabbit ventricular myocytes
