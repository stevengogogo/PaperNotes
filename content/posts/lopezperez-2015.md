## Introduction
* Nowadays, 3D cardiac models are becoming increasingly complex and are currently used in other areas such as cardiac image segmentation, statistical modelling of cardiac anatomy, patient risk stratification or surgical planning

## Evolution of 3D models of cardiac anatomy
### Generic models
* Geometric models
* anatomical models: the rabbit model from University of California San Diego and the canine model from University of Auckland
* computer-aided design (CAD) tools
### Medical image-based models
* CT / MRI images => patient-specific models

* Cardiac atlases
* highly-detailed bi-ventricular models built from very high resolution ex-vivo MRI datasets (~25 μm per slice) from small mammalian hearts

## Elements of a 3D cardiac computational model

### Geometry
* completeness and the anatomical realism and accuracy required by a particular 3D cardiac model will strongly depend on its final application
* structurally simplified models (without endocardial details or vessels) are well suited for a large range of 3D cardiac modelling applications aimed at EP simulation

* Medical image-based models can include patient-specific details obtained from clinical imaging data and/or population-based properties collected from ex-vivo datasets
* Ex-vivo cardiac images can provide much higher spatial resolution than in-vivo datasets
* In-vivo images can provide both anatomical and temporal patient-specific information, thus enabling the characterisation of cardiac motion
### Meshing

* finite-element method (FEM) enabled the resolution of complex biophysical problems
* tetrahedral, hexahedral, cubic Hermite elements
* Spatial (ds) and temporal discretisation (dt) constraints are imposed when biophysical models are used, which are in the order of ds = 0.1-0.5 mm and dt = 0.05-0.005 ms
* For the case of phenomenological models, such as Eikonal ones, spatial and temporal discretisation is less demanding (order of ds = 0.5 mm, dt = 1 ms), resulting in faster computation times.
### Myocardial structure: fibre orientation

* rule-based algorithms
* measurements (histology, imaging)
* Diffusion tensor-MRI (DT-MRI), also called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI):  diffusion of water molecules within the biological tissues

### Cardiac conduction system

### Electrophysiology

* cellular-level equations and the tissue-level equations
* Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) formalism vs Markov-type models (more mechanistic detailed)
* EP models are now highly specific and include human atrial, ventricular and Purkinje cells in normal or diseased conditions
* The number of state variables in the ionic AP models (and thus the number of ODEs) can be as high as 48
#### Electrophysiological heterogeneities
* The ventricular wall is not homogeneous, as cardiac myocytes in different portions of the ventricles exhibit different ionic currents and APs.
* epicardial-endocardial, apico-basal and left-right differences
#### Tissue level models
* bidomain model: extracellular and intracellular domains: two partial differential equations (PDEs) + a set of ODE systems
* equal anisotropy ratios are assumed in diffusion tensors: monodomain approach: one reaction-diffusion PDE plus a set of ODE systems
* Highly computationally demanding esp. using FEM
* Eikonal approximation, which replaces the reaction-diffusion equation with an eikonal equation that is simpler and based on a Huygens approach
#### Electromechanical coupling
* Ca2+ cycling => EC coupling => myocyte shortening
* Acute changes in ventricular mechanics can affect cardiac EP: stretch-activated ion channels, mechanical modulation of cell calcium handling
### Pathology
* functional remodelling: electrical / mechanical
* Chronic or healed ischaemic injuries resulting from myocardial infarctions (infarct **scars**)
* diffuse myocardial fibrosis
