## INTRODUCTION
* Ca2+ is the central signaling molecule for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling
* Mitochondrial matrix free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]mito) is determined by the balance between Ca2+ uptake, extrusion, and buffering
  * uptake: MCU (mainly,  Ru360–sensitive), rapid mode (RaM), mRyR
  * extrusion: mNCE, mPTP
  * buffering: Pi
* the dynamics and quantitative determinants of changes in [Ca2+]mito are incompletely understood

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
* adult guinea pig hearts as Aon et al.
* ΔΨm: TMRM
* extramitochondrial Ca: Calcium green 5N
* Matrix Ca: fura-FF, requires calibration

## RESULTS
![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362519/bin/JGP_201210784_Fig2.jpg "Response to Ca additions")

* ΔΨm decreased by only 3 mV (188 to 185mV) after the first Ca2+ addition but did not change for subsequent additions
* For both small and large Ca additions, steady-state [Ca2+]mito settled into a range between 15 and 20 µM
* the ratio of bound/free Ca2+ spanned from ∼3 to 30,000

* The slowing of the Ca2+ uptake rate with MgATP could be attributed to the increased Mg2+ present in the solution

![fig7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362519/bin/JGP_201210784_Fig7.jpg "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) dependence of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake")
* varying Pi over the range of 0.1 to 10 mM for both large and small Ca2+ additions
* the Ca2+ buffering action of Pi facilitates the regulation of [Ca2+]mito down to low levels in the face of very high mitochondrial Ca2+ loads and preserves the energy state of the mitochondria

![fig8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362519/bin/JGP_201210784_Fig8.jpg "Effects of Pi, (black), arsenate (Asi, blue), or vanadate (Vi, red) anions on the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+")
* Pi analogues: vanadate (Vi), or arsenate
* the total Ca2+ load at which PTP was triggered was markedly lower with Vi or Asi

## DISCUSSION
* MCU(mode1) required at least 1 µM Ru360 to be completely inhibited: esponded to small Ca2+ additions, faster => For Ca signaling
* MCU(mode2) was blocked by <100 nM Ru360: bulk of total Ca2+ uptake for large Ca2+ additions, slower => For Ca buffering
* small amounts of Ca2+ uptake lead to large changes in [Ca2+]mito, whereas large Ca2+ additions give only a transient increase in [Ca2+]mito with no change or an even a lower steady-state Ca2+
* Substitution of Pi with Asi or Vi had striking effects on [Ca2+]mito and the threshold for PTP activation. Interestingly, Asi and Vi had opposite effects on [Ca2+]mito for multiple pulses but they both sensitized the mitochondria to PTP activation

* In conclusion, understanding mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics requires quantitative assessment of not only Ca2+ influx and efflux rates across the mitochondria, but rates of matrix Ca2+ buffering at different Ca2+ loads and rates of entry
