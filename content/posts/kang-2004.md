NCX1 cannot generate larger Ca2+ gradients than expected for a Na+/Ca2+ transport ratio of 3:1, and that Na+ transported in **excess of a 3:1 ratio** moves as Ca2+-dependent Na+ slippage

3 conducting modes: 3 Na+ can exchange for 1 Ca2+, 1 Na+ and 1â€‰Ca2+ can exchange for 1 Ca2+ (that is, a Na+-conducting mode), and 1 Ca2+ and 1 Na+ can exchange for 3 Na+ ions (that is, a net 2 Na+/1 Ca2+ exchange)
