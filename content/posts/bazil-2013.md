## Introduction
* The biochemical equation of Complex III for the net reaction is shown as

* Previous models are either too simple or too complex
* The model developed here maintains the features presented above in a tenable, well-constrained representation of the bc1 complex

## Methods

###  Model structure

* This model includes the redox biochemistry that occurs at the Qo-site and Qi-site of the complex and couples cyt c reduction with the first electron transfer from ubiquinol
* This first electron transfer at the Qo-site is the one of the primary, rate-limiting steps in the catalytic cycle
* we assume that up to two mobile electrons can exist at both the Qo-site and Qi-site
* 6 states
* The fractional substate occupancies and the state transitions are governed by the thermodynamic driving force of the redox biochemistry defined by the midpoint potentials some of them being pH-dependent
* Binding polynomials for Qo, Qi site, and ISP FeS
* Under the right circumstances when cyt bL is reduced, there is a small but significant level of SQ at the Qo-site
* State transitions are governed by two primary Gibb’s free energies of reaction.
* The net turnover flux through the enzyme: ![](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/2037591218/2051990558/si45.gif)
* Superoxide production rate:

*  analytic expressions for the states at steady state
![](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/2037591218/2051990561/si48.gif)
* The analytical solution for each state contains ∼1000 terms, so they are not explicitly presented here (using KA method ?)

## Results and Discussion
* [Table1](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(13)00616-4#tbl1): fixed parameter values obtained from the literature and used to simulate the model
    * midpoint potentials, stability constants, pKa values, and other parameters
* [Table2](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(13)00616-4#tbl2):  fitted parameter values and sesitivity

* The cyt c binding constants were assumed to be similar to the fitted constants for horse heart cyt c, based on its apparent universal nature as a substrate for bc1 complexes from other species
