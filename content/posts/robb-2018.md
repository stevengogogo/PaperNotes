## Introduction of RET
* The production of superxoide at complex I can be driven by reverse electron transport (RET) by a highly reduced coenzyme Q (CoQ) pool and a large protonmotive force ($\Delta p$).

## Methods
* Isolated rat heart mitochondria.
* Measure H2O2 generation as a function of the membrane potential ($\Delta\Psi$) and of the reduction state of the CoQ and NADH pools. Hydrogen peroxide efflux from mitochondria is proportional to superxoide production.
* Altering $\Delta\Psi$ with the uncoupler FCCP and also oxidizing the CoQ pool by ectopic expression within heart mitochondria of the alternative oxidase (AOX) from *Ciona intestinalis*. O2 concentrations are also taken into account
* $\Delta p$ : TPMP ($\Delta\Psi$ indicator) and $\Delta pH$ as constant
* NADH: NAD(P)H fluorescence (NADPH pool is much smaller than NADH's)

## Results
### Dependence on mitochondrial membrane potential

* substrate: 10 mM potassium succinate
* rotenone ($5 \mu M$) : Q reductase site inhibitior
* nigericin($1 \mu M$) :K+ / H+ ionophore
* O2 = $200 \mu M$ (air saturated)
* Complex I inhibitor rotenone decreased H2O2 production without affecting $\Delta\Psi$ or the Q pool, but oxidation of the NAD(P)H pool => RET
* Add uncoupler FCCP (decrease $\Delta\Psi$) => H2O2 production decreased
* Use nigericin (K+ / H+ exchanger) to make matrix pH the same as the environment (7.4) without changing $\Delta p$ (compensatory increase of $\Delta\Psi$)

### Dependence on Q redox state

* Alternative oxidase (AOX) bypass complex III and IV, oxidizes QH2
    * Not sensitive to cyanide inhibition, but sensitive to N-propyl gallate
+ Oxidation of Q pool by AOX reduces superoxide production

### Dependence on oxygen concentration

* A: no direct oxidation of indicator by molecular oxygen. Only levels of hydrogen peroxide could affect the fluorescence
* Production of superoxide by RET at complex I is proportional (linear) to oxygen concentration
    * FCCP abolished it
    * Different from FET-ROS by rotenone + G/M or antimycin, with a pleatau


### Effects of drugs to reduce RET ROS formation

* MitoQ: a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant based on ubiquinone
* decylTPP: control compound to correct for nonspecific effects of MitoQ
* SS31: a peptide
* CN-POBS: an inhibitor of mitochondrial ROS production by RET at complex I
* metformin and phenformin (antidiabetics): complex I inhibitor
* effects of these compounds on RET at complex I may be indirect
    * Decreased $\Delta\Psi$
    * Oxidized NADH and CoQ pool

## Thermodynamic force

Driving force for one electron transfer from NADH to Q:
$$
\Delta E_{h}=E_{h}\left(\frac{\mathrm{NAD}^{+}}{\mathrm{NADH}}\right)-E_{h}\left(\frac{\mathrm{CoQ}}{\mathrm{CoQH}_{2}}\right)
$$
Driving force for the full reaction: (NADH-Q vs pumping 4 protons)
$$
\Delta G=2 F \Delta E_{h}-4 F \Delta \mathrm{p}
$$
Thermodynamic driving force of RET in volts
$$
-\Delta G / F=4 \Delta \mathrm{p}-2 \Delta E_{h}
$$

* A compound that only affects ROS production by RET indirectly through altering $\Delta p$ and $\Delta E_h$ would lie on the curve shown
* In contrast, a compound that directly affected complex I independently of the thermodynamic drivers of RET, would lie below this curve.
* Nigericin: decrease in H2O2 production was due to its effects on the CoQ pool redox state, hence changing the thermodynamic driving forces for RET
* Rotenone: not changing the thermodynamic driving forces for RET. Specific inhibitory effects on complex I.
* The drugs: more likely to be accounted for by their effects on $\Delta p$ and/or $\Delta E_h$ rather than due to specific inhibitory effects on complex I.

## Discussion
* ROS production by RET at complex I is favored by a high $\Delta p$ and a reduced CoQ pool. also highly responsive to small changes in the overall thermodynamic driving force for RET across the complex
* We favor the **FMN site** as the source of superoxide production by complex I during RET
    * The penetration of O2 to the CoQ site is difficult to envisage from the structure of complex I. The superoxide anion is thermodynamically unfavorable in the hydrophobic area.
    * the FMN site is well established as a source of superoxide production by rotenone-inhibited complex I. And any superoxide formed at this site is released directly into the aqueous phase.
    * Linear dependence of oxygen concentration: second-order reaction between O2 and FMNH; NAD/NADH has no direct effect.
* Why ROS formation of RET greater than FET?
    * Midpoint potential of FMN/FMNH = -380mV, compared to NAD/NADH = -335mV
    * RET => relatively more FMNH and more semiquinone radical FMN_dot
* During RET, NAD/NADH pool is highly reduced and there is no net electron flow from complex I into this pool.

* the calculation of G / F requires a number of assumptions and combines several technically challenging experimental measurements
* not considering super complex formation
* One of the beneficial effects by metformin *in vivo* maybe due to limiting ROS generation by limiting RET
