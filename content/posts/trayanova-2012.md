## Introduction
* iterative interaction between experimentation and simulation
* the heart is the most highly advanced example of a virtual organ, capable of integrating data at multiple scales, from genes to the whole organ.
## Subject-specific biophysically-detailed modelling of the heart for optimization and advancement of therapies for arrhythmias and pump dysfunction
* Imaging: ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

* Computational modelling of the electrophysiology of the human atria is also becoming an important component in the evaluation and advancement of therapeutic strategies

* biophysically detailed electromechanical models of the heart

* maximal haemodynamic benefit occurred when the LV pacing site was located near the base and mid-ventricle, which was within the region of longest electromechanical delay

## Biophysically-detailed computational modelling of the heart as a testbed for new molecular therapies
* A major avenue of scientific inquiry in computational cardiology relates the binding/unbinding of drugs to molecular target(s) to the instigation, termination or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias
* Markov models with state specific drug binding/unbinding have been used to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of drug effects on macroscopic currents

## Biophysically detailed computational modelling of novel defibrillation therapies
* biophysically detailed multi-scale models of defibrillation have made major contributions to understanding how defibrillation shocks used in clinical practice interact with cardiac tissue.
* development of new methodologies for low-voltage termination of lethal arrhythmias or for applying defibrillation in novel, less damaging ways
* kilohertz-range alternating current (AC) fields have been known to instantaneous and reversibly block electrical conduction in nerve tissue => similarly produce reversible block of cardiac impulse propagation and lead to successful defibrillation

## Biophysically detailed computational modelling of the heart in risk stratification for arrhythmias
* who would benefit from Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) therapy
* results of clinical trials to correlate surface EGG indices to lethal cardiac arrhythmias are often contradictory => EP simulations come into play
* a steep action potential duration (APD) restitution (>1) at rapid heart rates67 produces alternans in APD that underlie T-wave alternans and the genesis of fibrillation
* detecting instabilities in the QT interval in clinical ECGs can predict VT onset

## Inverse problem in electrocardiography: computational modelling of the heart as a diagnostic tool
* The application of inverse electrocardiography in humans has been led by the Rudy lab
* electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) method computes epicardial extracellular potential distributions

## Concluding remarks
* Modern cardiac research has increasingly recognized that appropriate models and simulation can help interpret an array of experimental data and dissect important mechanisms and relationships.
