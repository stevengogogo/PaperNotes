## Introduction
* Cardiac electrophysiology: experimental research coupled with integrative mathematical modeling
* CaMKII: an important signaling pathway involving EC coupling (ECC)
* CaMKII modulates LCCs via a Ca2+-dependent positive-feedback regulatory mechanism known as *ICaL facilitation*
* In cardiac myocytes, an activated CaMKII molecule can undergo autophosphorylation by neighboring subunits
* Oxidative CaMKII activation is also identified.
* Models:

## Models of oxidative CaMKII activation and regulation

* Foteinou et al, 2013
* future studies will focus on establishing quantitative links between cellular ROS and redox balance, CaMKII activity and function, ECC, and whole-cell electrophysiology
* the ROS regulation module of Gauthier et al. (2013b) enables its use in larger scale heart models designed to simulate and study how mitochondrial ROS and the functional consequences of its accumulation, such as CaMKII oxidation

## Conclusion
* CaMKII as a nexus point linking heart failure and arrhythmias
* LCC and RyR activation mechanisms may co-exist in heart failure, and it is likely that both play an important role
* CaMKII modulation of other targets such as PLB, INa (late), and K+ currents
