## Introduction
* Creatine kinase (CK) is a central controller of cellular energy homeostasis: PCr + ADP <=> Cr + ATP

## Mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) —an enzyme central to cellular energetics
![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/86718653-dfefa880-c055-11ea-80e2-186debe864f6.png)

* @ cristae and intermembrane space
* phosphocreatine: buffer
* (In the cmpartments) metabolite channeling or functional coupling
    * high local [ATP]/[ADP] ratios in the vicinity of cellular ATPases
    * low at ATP synthase

## Dual localization of creatine kinase microcompartments in mitochondria

* IMS is a microcompartment for adenylates
    * IMS height = 9nm. (Could fit mtCK octamer)
    * Cristae junctions (pendiculi) <= 10–15 nm
    * VDAC is a rate-limiting diffusion barrier

## MtCK proteolipid complexes in contact sites
* channeling of ‘‘high-energy’’ phosphates, regulated by the energy state
* Proteolipid complexes
    * adenine translocator (ANT) in IMM
    * VDAC in OMM
    * Kinases (e.g. mtCK, NDP kinase @ IMS, mtHK @ OMM)
    * apoptotic proteins: cyt c, Bcl-2,
    * protective effect on mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)
* Only octameric MtCK shows a high affinity to cardiolipin and other anionic phospholipids and stucks in the membrane
* Calcium is yet another signal that seems to regulate MtCK complexes

## Function of MtCK proteolipid complexes in metabolite channeling and apoptosis
* Streamlined metabolite exchange (fusing rxn of VDAC, mtCK, & ANT): ATP(m) + Cr(i) <=> ADP(m) + PCr(i)
* The degree of such metabolite channeling seems to vary among different tissues, species, and developmental states
* MtCK could play the role of an energy sensor, coupling cellular energy state to programmed cell death

## Mitochondrial creatine kinase—from molecular damage to pathological states
### MtCK—a prime target of oxidative and radical-induced molecular damage
* All CK isoenzymes are extremely susceptible to damage by ROS and RNS (superoxide anions (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH), nitrogen monoxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (PN, ONOO*)
* Mitochondrial ROS can also be generated by pharmacological interventions, e.g., with **anthracyclines**, a prominent class of anti-cancer drugs
* Enzyme inactivation (active site) & interfere with oligomeric state and membrane binding capacity of mtCK (dimer/dimer interface)
* CK inactivation is irreversible, especially at higher ROS concentrations
    * MtCK is particularly susceptible to PN treatment (μM range)
    * sMtCK (heart, muscle) octamers are more susceptible to PN than those of uMtCK (brain)

### Impairment of MtCK in ischemia and cardiomyopathy
* "stability paradox" in heart: metabolic homeostasis despite large fluctuations in work load
    * Relies on CK shuttle running by mtCK, esp. sMtCK (sMtCK isoenzyme can make up to 25% of total CK activity in rat heart)
    * mitochondrial volume ~40% of cellular volume
    * Lack in Cr or mtCK => reduced performance and cardiomyopathy in KO rats
* vicious cycle from ROS: ischemia/reperfusion injury => increased ROS => inactivation of mtCK => less cytosolic ATP => Ca overload => more ROS/RNS => ... => mitochondrial permeability transition, apoptosis and/or necrosis
* ischemic preconditioning => protection to sMtCK and ANT complex => higher energy flux through CK

### Involvement of MtCK in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity
* severe acute and chronic cardiotoxicity still represent serious complications of anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin) therapy
* oxidative damage and functional impairment of MtCK in a dose-, time-, and drug-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo
* MtCK as well as ANT are preferentially hit by the drug (competition for cardiolipin)
* 10–30μM doxorubicin complexed with iron induced sMtCK inactivation within several tens of minutes
* Dimerization and inhibition of sMtCK membrane binding could also destabilize mitochondrial contact sites
* Organs that lack MtCK (liver) or express high levels of uMtCK (e.g., kidney and brain) do not show severe anthracycline toxicity

### Impairment of MtCK in neurodegenerative disorders
* ROS => inactivation of uMtCK in the brain
* uMtCK inacitvation observed in AD and ALS
* Creatine supplementation?

## Up-regulation of mitochondrial creatine kinase in human health and disease
* sMtCK expression follows the simultaneous induction of mitochondria,
* in situations of high aerobic workload, the energy transport function of sMtCK is important
* up-regulation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) => expression of sMtCK
* Creatine depletion by β-GPA feeding => energy cirsis => crystalline inclusions (mtCK) in the mitochondria due to compensatory overexpression. Also seen in mitochondrial cytopathies.

* Overexpression of uMtCK in cancer (protection against apoptosis)
