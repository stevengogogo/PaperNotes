## Introduction
* low levels of ROS having beneficial effects through stimulation of mitohormesis and high levels causing oxidative damage and contributing to aging
* few studies describing how much ROS each respiratory complex produces in vivo due to the lack of resolution with these type of measurements
* *in vitro*, CI generates ROS exclusively into the mitochondrial matrix, while CIII can produce ROS into either the matrix or intermembrane space
* Reverse electron transpor (RET) was considered an *in vitro* experimental artifact until recently.
* high ratio of ubiquinol(QH2) to ubiquinone(Q) and a high proton motive force ($\Delta p$) is required to produce RET.

## WHERE ARE ROS PRODUCED WITHIN CI

* Feeding glutamate or pyruvate: forward electron transport (FET)
    * Add rotenone => FMN (IF site) reduced => ROS formation
    * independent of both the redox state of CoQ and $\Delta p$
* Feeding high concentration succinate: reverse electron transport (RET)
    * Add rotenone => IQ site blocked => reduced ROS formation
    * dependent on both the redox state of CoQ and $\Delta p$
    * ROS formation @ IF or IQ site?
* How ROS are generated (i.e., in forward or reverse direction) at CI affects how several proteins are oxidized
    * Site specific antioxidants fpor treatment?
    * positive effects of metformin are caused by a site-specific inhibition of CI that triggers a specific ROS signal.

## RET and health

* RET-derived ROS is a good metabolic indicator
    * redox state of CoQ (electron flow through the ETC)
    * proton motive force: mitochondrial energy state
    * O2 concentration (linear relationship)
* Inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes by rotenone
* ETC supercomplex reflects metabolic supply and needs
    * CI+ CIII + CIV, CI+ CIII and CIII + CIV, in addition to CIV alone
    * Glucose: NAH / FADH2 = 5 vs lipid: 2
    * Under lipid diet, RET-ROS promotes the degradation of CI increasing the association between CIII and CIV, which is more efficient for the oxidation of fatty acids.
* macrophages reorganize their RC, decreasing the levels of CI and increasing activity of CII for inflammatory response
    * switching to producing ATP via glycolysis instead of OXPHOS
    * Suppression of RET-ROS inhibits the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines required to fight bacterial infection
* sensing of oxygen levels by the carotid body (CB)
    * hypoxia: CII activity increased, RET
* Drosophila extends lifespan by induction of RET-ROS *in vivo*
    * Ectopic expression of NDI1 => Q pool more reduced => RET (blockable by rotenone)
    * co-expression of NDI1 with a mitochondrially-targeted catalase abolished lifespan ext ension conferred by NDI1
* Hypoxia-reperfusion injury
    * excess of ROS produced via RET due to succinate accumulates in ischemic tissues
    * Inhibition of CII with dimethyl-malonate or CI with rotenone protects the heart during ischemia-reperfusion
* new generation of antioxidants that specifically neutralize ROS produced at the IQ site within CI also alleviate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion in the heart
